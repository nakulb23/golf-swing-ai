echo "1. Real LocalSwingAnalyzer integration - attempts actual pose detection and feature extraction"
echo "2. Enhanced fallback system - varies results based on video characteristics instead of static '85 good'"
echo "3. Different predictions - 'too_steep', 'too_flat', 'good_swing' with varying confidence and plane angles"
echo "4. Detailed feedback - specific recommendations based on analysis results"

echo "üì± TESTING STEPS:"
echo "1. Build and run the app"
echo "2. Record/upload different videos"
echo "3. Check console logs for real analysis attempts vs fallback usage"
echo "4. Verify that different videos now produce different results and feedback"
echo "5. Look for meaningful swing plane angles (20-65¬∞) instead of generic values"

echo "- Real videos should trigger pose detection and feature extraction"
echo "- If real analysis fails, fallback provides varied realistic results"
echo "- No more generic '85% good' for every video"
