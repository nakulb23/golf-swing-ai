# Core ML Model Setup for Golf Swing AI

## Overview
This guide explains how to create and integrate production Core ML models for the Golf Swing AI app. The app uses Core ML for on-device swing analysis, providing real-time feedback without requiring internet connectivity.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Xcode 14+
- macOS 12.0+

## Step 1: Install Required Python Packages

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow coremltools numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Step 2: Create the Core ML Model

We have two options for creating the model:

### Option A: Use Pre-trained Model (Recommended)
1. Download the pre-trained model from the project repository
2. Place `SwingAnalysisModel.mlpackage` in your project directory

### Option B: Train Your Own Model
1. Navigate to the iOS project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/nakulbhatnagar/Desktop/Golf\ Swing\ AI/frontend/ios
```

2. Run the training script:
```bash
python3 create_coreml_models.py
```

This will create:
- `SwingAnalysisModel.mlpackage` - The Core ML model
- `model_metadata.json` - Feature names and normalization parameters
- `swing_analysis_keras_model.h5` - Backup Keras model

## Step 3: Add Model to Xcode Project

1. Open your Xcode project
2. Drag `SwingAnalysisModel.mlpackage` into your project navigator
3. Ensure the following settings:
   - ✅ Copy items if needed
   - ✅ Create folder references
   - ✅ Add to target: Golf Swing AI

4. Build the project to compile the model

## Step 4: Add Supporting Files

1. Copy `SwingAnalysisMLModel.swift` to your project
2. Ensure it's added to the correct target
3. Copy `model_metadata.json` to your project bundle (optional, for feature names)

## Model Architecture

### Input Features (35 total)
The model expects 35 physics-based features extracted from pose data:

#### Setup Features (5)
- spine_angle
- knee_flexion
- weight_distribution
- arm_hang_angle
- stance_width

#### Backswing Features (10)
- max_shoulder_turn
- hip_turn_at_top
- x_factor
- swing_plane_angle
- arm_extension
- weight_shift
- wrist_hinge
- backswing_tempo
- head_movement
- knee_stability

#### Transition Features (5)
- transition_tempo
- hip_lead
- weight_transfer_rate
- wrist_timing
- sequence_efficiency

#### Downswing Features (8)
- hip_rotation_speed
- shoulder_rotation_speed
- club_path_angle
- attack_angle
- release_timing
- left_side_stability
- downswing_tempo
- power_generation

#### Impact Features (7)
- impact_position
- extension_through_impact
- follow_through_balance
- finish_quality
- overall_tempo
- rhythm_consistency
- swing_efficiency

### Output Classes
The model classifies swings into three categories:
- `good_swing` - Optimal swing mechanics
- `too_steep` - Swing plane is too vertical
- `too_flat` - Swing plane is too horizontal

## Usage in Code

```swift
// Load the model
let analyzer = LocalSwingAnalyzer()

// Analyze a swing from video
let videoURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "path/to/video.mp4")
let result = try await analyzer.analyzeSwing(from: videoURL)

// Access results
print("Swing type: \(result.predicted_label)")
print("Confidence: \(result.confidence)")
print("Swing plane: \(result.plane_angle ?? 0)°")
```

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~95% on validation set
- **Inference Time**: <50ms on iPhone 12+
- **Model Size**: ~2MB
- **Supported iOS**: 13.0+

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
1. Verify the model file is in the bundle:
```swift
if Bundle.main.url(forResource: "SwingAnalysisModel", withExtension: "mlpackage") != nil {
    print("Model found in bundle")
}
```

2. Check console for error messages
3. Ensure model is compiled (check for .mlmodelc in derived data)

### Poor Predictions
1. Verify pose detection is working correctly
2. Check that all 35 features are being extracted
3. Ensure features are in the correct order
4. Verify normalization is applied if needed

### App Crashes
1. Check memory usage - model should use <50MB
2. Verify iOS version compatibility
3. Check for threading issues (use MainActor for UI updates)

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Feature Extraction
Modify `SwingFeatureExtractor` in `LocalAIManager.swift` to adjust feature calculations.

### Model Updates
To update the model:
1. Retrain with new data
2. Increment version in model metadata
3. Replace the .mlpackage file
4. Test thoroughly before release

### Performance Optimization
- Use batch predictions for multiple swings
- Cache model predictions when appropriate
- Consider quantization for smaller model size

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Model file added to Xcode project
- [ ] Model compiles without errors
- [ ] Feature extraction working correctly
- [ ] Predictions returning valid results
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance tested on target devices
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] UI updates on main thread
- [ ] Fallback for model loading failures
- [ ] Analytics tracking for model performance

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all files are properly added to the project
3. Ensure iOS deployment target is 13.0+
4. Test on physical device (not just simulator)
