## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Model Not Loading**
```swift
// Check bundle contains model
guard let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "SwingAnalysisModel", withExtension: "mlmodel") else {
    print("❌ Model not found in bundle")
    return
}
```

**API Connection Failures**
```swift
// Verify API endpoint
let baseURL = "https://golfai.duckdns.org:8443"
// Check SSL certificates
// Verify network permissions
```

**Data Collection Not Working**
- Check user consent status
- Verify API endpoints responding
- Test offline storage working
- Confirm data validation passing

**Low User Feedback Rate**
- Review prompt frequency
- Simplify feedback UI
- Add incentives for participation
- Test prompt timing

## 📝 Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found
1. **Immediate**: Disable data collection via remote config
2. **Short-term**: Revert to previous app version if needed
3. **Long-term**: Fix issues and redeploy

### Rollback Triggers
- Crash rate > 3%
- User rating drops below 3.0
- Data privacy breach
- Critical API failures
- Model accuracy drops significantly
