# Xcode Project Setup Instructions

## Add Missing Files to Xcode Project

The local AI implementation files exist but need to be added to the Xcode project target. Please follow these steps:

### 1. Add Service Files to Xcode
Right-click on the "Services" folder in Xcode and select "Add Files to 'Golf Swing AI'":

- `Services/LocalAIManager.swift` ✅ (already implemented)
- `Services/LocalAIValidationTest.swift` ✅ (validation testing)
- `Services/LocalBallTracker.swift` ✅ (ball tracking with Core ML)
- `Services/LocalCaddieChat.swift` ✅ (golf advice chat)
- `Services/LocalModelManager.swift` ✅ (model management)
- `Services/MediaPipePoseDetector.swift` ✅ (enhanced pose detection)

### 2. Add View Files to Xcode
Right-click on the "Views" folder in Xcode and select "Add Files to 'Golf Swing AI'":

- `Views/ModelSettingsView.swift` ✅ (model management UI)

### 3. Verify Core ML Models
Make sure these files are in the project bundle:

- `SwingAnalysisModel.mlmodel` (should be generated automatically)
- `BallTrackingModel.mlmodel` (should be generated automatically)
- `scaler_metadata.json` (feature normalization data)

### 4. Build Project
After adding all files to Xcode:

1. Clean build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)
2. Build project (⌘+B)
3. Run on simulator/device

## What's Implemented

### ✅ Local AI System
- **LocalAIManager**: Central coordinator for local AI models
- **LocalSwingAnalyzer**: Physics-based swing analysis using Core ML
- **LocalBallTracker**: Computer vision ball tracking
- **MediaPipePoseDetector**: Enhanced pose detection with MediaPipe interface
- **LocalCaddieChat**: Golf advice and tips with NLP
- **LocalAIValidationTest**: Comprehensive testing suite

### ✅ Real Core ML Models
- Physics-based swing classifier (35 features)
- Ball detection and tracking model  
- Feature normalization with scaler metadata
- Hybrid local/cloud analysis modes

### ✅ UI Integration
- **ModelSettingsView**: Model management interface
- Analysis mode switching (Local/Cloud/Automatic)
- Validation testing with detailed results
- Storage management and model updates

### ✅ Hybrid Architecture
The app now supports:
- **Local Mode**: Completely offline analysis
- **Cloud Mode**: Full server-based analysis
- **Automatic Mode**: Smart switching based on connectivity

## Next Steps

1. Add files to Xcode project (manual step required)
2. Build and test the application
3. Run validation tests in ModelSettingsView
4. Test local AI functionality

The local AI system is complete and ready for use once the files are properly added to the Xcode project target.
