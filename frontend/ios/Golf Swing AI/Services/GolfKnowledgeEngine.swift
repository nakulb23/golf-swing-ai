            A chip shot is a short, low-trajectory shot played around the green to get the ball close to the hole.
            
            **Key characteristics:**
            â€¢ Distance: 10-30 yards from green
            â€¢ Trajectory: Low flight, mostly roll
            â€¢ Clubs: Wedges, 9-iron, 8-iron
            â€¢ Setup: Narrow stance, weight forward
            â€¢ Ball position: Back of center
            
            **Technique:**
            1. Hands ahead of ball at address and impact
            2. Small backswing, accelerate through
            3. Hit ball first, then turf
            4. Minimal wrist action
            
            **Club selection rule:** Higher loft = more air time, less roll. Lower loft = less air time, more roll.

            â€¢ Need more spin to stop the ball
            
            **Technique:**
            1. Wider stance than chip shot
            2. More weight on front foot (60-70%)
