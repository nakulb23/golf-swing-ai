# Google Sign-In Setup Guide for Golf Swing AI

## Current Status ✅
- Apple Sign-In is now properly implemented and should work
- Code prepared for Google Sign-In integration
- Mock implementations are working for Google and Facebook

## Step 1: Add Google Sign-In Package

1. Open `Golf Swing AI.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Go to **File → Add Package Dependencies...**
3. Enter URL: `https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS`
4. Select the latest version (7.1.0+)
5. Add the **GoogleSignIn** product to your "Golf Swing AI" target

## Step 2: Google Cloud Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Search for "Google Sign-In API" and enable it
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth Client ID**
5. Select **iOS** as application type
6. Enter your bundle identifier: `com.yourcompany.Golf-Swing-AI` (check your actual bundle ID in Xcode)
7. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
8. Drag and drop this file into your Xcode project (make sure to add it to the target)

## Step 3: Configure Info.plist

Add these entries to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` with the value from GoogleService-Info.plist (it looks like `com.googleusercontent.apps.123456789-abcdef...`)

## Step 4: Enable the Code

After adding the package and GoogleService-Info.plist:

1. In `AuthenticationManager.swift`:
   - Uncomment: `import GoogleSignIn`
   - Uncomment the real Google Sign-In implementation (remove the mock)

2. In `Golf_Swing_AIApp.swift`:
   - Uncomment: `import GoogleSignIn`
   - Uncomment the Google configuration code in `onAppear`

## Step 5: Test Apple Sign-In

The Apple Sign-In should now work properly:
- Shows native Apple popup
- Handles user cancellation gracefully
- Creates user account and dismisses login modal

## For Facebook Sign-In

If you want to implement Facebook Login:

1. Add Facebook SDK via CocoaPods or SPM
2. Create app at [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
3. Configure Info.plist with Facebook App ID
4. Similar pattern to Google implementation

## Testing Notes

- **Apple Sign-In**: Test on real device (doesn't work well in simulator)
- **Google Sign-In**: Works in simulator and device
- **Bundle ID**: Make sure it matches what's configured in Google Cloud Console

## Current Working Features

✅ Apple Sign-In - Properly implemented with native popup
✅ Google Sign-In - Mock working, ready for real implementation  
✅ Facebook Sign-In - Mock working, ready for real implementation
✅ Email/Password Sign-In - Working
✅ User Registration - Working
✅ Auto-dismiss login modal - Working

The Apple Sign-In issue has been fixed with proper delegate retention and synchronous calls.
