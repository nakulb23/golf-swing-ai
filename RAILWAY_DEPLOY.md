# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide for Golf Swing AI

## Prerequisites
1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Account**: Your code needs to be in a GitHub repository
3. **Git**: Make sure git is installed locally

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Golf Swing AI API ready for Railway deployment"

# Create GitHub repository (replace with your username)
# Then push to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/golf-swing-ai.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Railway

1. **Visit Railway**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Login**: Sign in with GitHub
3. **New Project**: Click "New Project" 
4. **Deploy from GitHub**: Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. **Select Repository**: Choose your golf-swing-ai repository
6. **Configure**: Railway will auto-detect Python and use our config files

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT` - Assigned by Railway
- `PYTHONPATH` - Set in railway.toml

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- **Build Logs**: Watch the build process in Railway dashboard
- **Deploy Logs**: Monitor startup logs
- **Health Check**: Railway will check `/health` endpoint

### 5. Get Your API URL
Once deployed, Railway provides a URL like:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## API Endpoints
Your hosted API will have:
- `GET /` - API overview
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /predict` - Swing analysis
- `POST /chat` - CaddieChat Q&A
- `POST /track-ball` - Ball tracking
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

## Testing Your Deployed API
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Test CaddieChat
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who won the 2024 Masters?"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Check `requirements.txt` compatibility
- Verify Python version in `runtime.txt`
- Monitor build logs for errors

### Runtime Issues  
- Check deploy logs for startup errors
- Verify model files are included in repo
- Ensure health check passes

### Performance
- Railway free tier has limitations
- Consider upgrading for production use
- Monitor resource usage in dashboard

## Files Added for Railway
- `Procfile` - Process definition
- `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- `runtime.txt` - Python version
- `requirements.txt` - Optimized dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Railway
2. Test all endpoints
3. Use the hosted URL for iOS app development
4. Monitor performance and logs

Your Golf Swing AI API will be live and ready for your iOS app! üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì±
